# Create a function named every_other_letter that takes a string named word as a parameter. The function should return a string containing every other letter in word.

# Write your every_other_letter function here:

def every_other_letter(word):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(word)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += word[i]
    return result

# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(every_other_letter("Codecademy"))
# should print Cdcdm
print(every_other_letter("Hello world!"))
# should print Hlowrd
print(every_other_letter(""))
# should print


#alternativa
# def every_other_letter(word):
#   every_other = ""
#   for i in range(0, len(word), 2):
#     every_other += word[i]
#   return every_other
